# Exercise 1: Hello World!
> Every programming language starter tutorial teaches you how to output "Hello, World!" using the language.

> But this exercise is not just for tradition.

> This will asses if you actually know HTML, which is one of the many prerequisites before learning React. Start by rendering a square with a background color. Inside the square, render "Hello, World!".

# Exercise 2: Capturing User Clicks
> What makes a web app different from a static website? A web app is interactive. Of course, there's more to web apps than capturing clicks, but it's important to start from the basics.

> This exercise gets you started with event handling, which is a basic concept not only in React but also in JavaScript (which is again another pre-requisite before learning React).

> Using the native HTML <button> tag, capture the click event and alert the message, "Clicked!".

> Take note that capturing events such as clicks is done differently in React than it is in JavaScript.
